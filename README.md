git-getpull
===========

Quickly find the GitHub pull request that merged your commit to master.

## Motivation

Ideally `git blame` would give you all the context you need to determine why some code was written. But the reality is that no team is perfectly disciplined, and sometimes you're going to run across commits with cryptic or ambiguous messages ("bugfix," anyone?).

When a git commit message doesn't provide enough context, or provides context at the wrong level (too much *what*, too little *why*), it's useful to be able to find the GitHub pull request that merged that commit. Pull requests can contain code review comments, discussion over implementation details, before/after pictures of the UI, and more. Pull requests may also have *many* commits associated with them, which together give a clearer sense of the intended change.

This utility allows you to find out which pull request merged a commit into master (assuming the commit came from a pull requestâ€”if it didn't, you're SOL!).

## Installation

(Replace `/usr/local/bin` with a location on your path if `/usr/local/bin` is not on your `$PATH`.)

```shell
$ curl -o /usr/local/bin/git-getpull https://raw.github.com/a-warner/git-getpull/master/git-getpull && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-getpull
```

## Usage

```shell
$ git getpull 42a3817c
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11195
```

## NB

This isn't a perfect tool: if a commit was made directly to master or a pull request was merged via `git rebase`, it will likely print a random pull request (since the script uses a simple `git log --ancestry-path` command to check for pull requests). Most of the time, however, it "does the right thing."
